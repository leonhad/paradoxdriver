 The PARADOX File Structure                         Compiled by Randy Beck

    I haven't made changes to this description for a long while, but not
    much has changed.  The latest revision concerns the tableName field,
    which I've discovered has lengthened in Paradox 7, and then another
    revision to that same field yet again.

    I'm not aware of any changes after Paradox 7.  But if anybody knows of
    anything different in Paradox 8 and 9 then please let me know.

    I should say here that many of the fields are listed here as pointers
    while the file is in memory.  I first made this connection back when
    Paradox 4 was still the state of the art.  I have not verified that
    this remains true, but a quick glance at some of the fields makes me
    think it's probably still true.


 This document details the binary file format for Paradox data files.
 There are still a few unknowns, but the important items are covered.

 I refer to the older table format as 3.0 tables and the newer ones as 4.0
 through 7.0, but I believe that most of the 3.0 information may also apply
 to the earlier versions.

 Pascal terms are used to describe data types:
     byte is 1 byte unsigned;
     integer is a 2-byte signed integer;
     word is a 2-byte unsigned integer;
     longint is a 4-byte signed integer;
     char is a 1-byte character;
     pchar is a pointer to a character;
     ^ modifies any type definition to a pointer to that type;
     ^pchar is a pointer to a pointer to a character.

 All pointers are 4-byte pointers.

 GENERAL FILE STRUCTURE
 ======================

    ============================
    |     Header               |
    |     Data Block 0         |
    |     Data Block 1         |
    |     Data Block 2         |
    |     ...                  |
    |     Data Block n         |
    ============================

 The size of the Paradox file header is usually 2048 bytes (see headerSize
 at file offset 0002).  The first portion (offsets 0000 to $0057) has fixed
 field locations.  The next section ($0058 to $0077) was new to Paradox 4.0
 data files.  The rest varies in size -- depending upon the upon the number
 of fields -- and is listed sequentially.

 Some of the information in the file header seems to be needed only while
 it is being used by Paradox in RAM.  A few of these fields are pointers to
 other fields in the header, and are valid only during run-time.  They are
 listed here anyway, although their meaning is subject to change and they
 serve little purpose for third-party software.

 The data area which follows is divided into record blocks.  These use 1024,
 2048, 3072 or 4096 bytes each, depending upon the maximum table size set
 when the table was created.  The field structure of the data area is itself
 unusual in that each data field is arranged in hi-byte to low-byte order.

 Note:  This hi-byte to low-byte arrangement only applies to the user data
 in the table.  Everything else uses the normal low-byte to hi-byte format.

 The structure of primary and secondary index files generally follows that
 of Paradox version 3 data files.




 Paradox Common File Header  -- offsets 0000 to 0057
 ==========================

 With some noted exceptions, this part of the description is common to data
 and index files.  Offsets in this list are given in hexadecimal.  Other
 numbers should be assumed as listed in decimal format unless preceded by a
 dollar sign ('$').

==============================================================================
| 0000 | integer     recordSize                                              |
|      |                                                                     |
|      |        This is the size of a user record in this table.             |
|      |                                                                     |
|      |        For primary index files, each "record" is actually the       |
|      |        field or fields in the index, plus three integers which      |
|      |        are not referenced in the header.                            |
|      |                                                                     |
|      |        Secondary index files also have additional fields, but       |
|      |        these are listed in the header.                              |
|      |                                                                     |
+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0002 | integer     headerSize (always $0800)                               |

|      |        You can change headerSize, and move the data blocks          |
|      |        accordingly, to create larger or smaller table headers.      |
|      |        Borland's TUTILITY program would flag an error, but          |
|      |        Paradox, the Borland Database Engine and the Paradox         |
|      |        Engine will all still work with these tables.                |
|      |                                                                     |

|      |        This is the "maximum table size" determined when this        |

|      |        This is the number of records in this file.                  |
|      |                                                                     |

|      |        I'm not certain what this really is, but it seems to be      |
|      |        the same as fileBlocks unless there is an empty block in     |
|      |        the table.                                                   |

|      |        This is the number of data blocks in the file.               |

|      |        This works out to the number of blocks that the table        |

|      |        The value of this field seems to the change when records     |

|      |        versions 3.0 and 3.5.  (It was a zero if not encrypted.)     |
|      |                                                                     |
|      |        Subsequent versions store the value $FF00FF00 here, and      |
|      |        move the encryption code to offset $005C.  Even so, these    |
|      |        newer versions still maintain this information at both       |
|      |        locations while working in RAM.                              |

|      |        Primary and .Ynn secondary index files always use this       |
|      |        field to store the encryption code, but it is often a        |
|      |        zero because the Paradox Engine and the Borland Database     |
|      |        Engine do not always encrypt index files.  You can encrypt   |
|      |        unencrypted index files by following these steps:            |
|      |                                                                     |
|      |           Begin with an empty encrypted table;                      |
|      |           Truncate the index files to headerSize;                   |
|      |           Zeroize nextBlock, fileBlocks, firstBlock and lastBlock;  |
|      |           Copy four bytes from the .DB data file's encryption1      |
|      |               field (for version 3), or the encryption2 field       |
|      |               (for versions 4 and above) into the encryption1       |
|      |               or encryption2 field of the index file;               |
|      |           Test thoroughly.                                          |

 Paradox Data Blocks
 ===================

 The data area begins at offset headerSize (usually $0800).  It is divided
 into blocks of 1024, 2048, 3072 or 4096 bytes -- depending upon the maximum
 table size set when the table was created.

 The entire data block will be encrypted if the table is encrypted.

|   The records in the data area are arranged in field order.  Alpha fields  |
|   are arrays of characters, padded with zeroes.  Other fields seem to be   |
|   arranged in hi-byte to low-byte order, with the first byte's high bit    |
|   set for positive numbers.                                                |
|                                                                            |
|   For example, the number 1 stored as a 2-byte Short integer field is      |
|   arranged this way:  $80, 01.  And the integer 256 would be stored as:    |
|   $81, 00.                                                                 |
|                                                                            |
|   Floating point Number and currency fields are 8-byte DOUBLE types,       |
|   hi-byte to low-byte, with the first byte's high bit set.                 |
|                                                                            |
|   Date fields are stored as the number of days since JAN-0-0000, in high-  |
|   byte to low-byte order with the first byte's high bit set.               |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|   If you are wondering why the first byte's high bit is set for positive   |
|   numbers, recall from the Paradox Engine's documentation that a "blank"   |
|   SHORT (2-byte) integer is assigned the value of $8000.  By using the     |
|   hi-byte to low-byte format, and by reversing the first byte's high bit,  |
|   the value $8000 is converted to all zeroes.  So a record stored as all   |
|   zeroes is actually all blanks.                                           |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|   The records in primary index files contain the field or fields in the    |
|   index -- plus three integers that are not described in the header's      |
|   fieldInfo area.                                                          |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
