Paradox Driver THANKS file

Paradox Driver was originally written by Leonardo Alves da Costa.  It would
not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these people,
who have reported problems, suggested improvements, or submitted
actual code.  Please help us keep this list complete and free from
errors.  Also see the AUTHORS file for the list of people with
contributions significant enough to warrant copyright assignment.

I want to give a special thanks to the pxlib producers. I used their
encryption code in this project. More in <http://pxlib.sourceforge.net/>.

Many people are not named here because we lost track of them.  We
thank them!  Please, help us keep this list up to date.
